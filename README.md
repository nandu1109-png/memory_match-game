# 📘 STAFF MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (C Programming)

## 📄 ABSTRACT
The **Staff Management System** is a terminal-based application written in **C** that allows users to manage staff or employee records efficiently. The system provides core functionalities such as adding new staff details, viewing records, searching by ID, updating information, and deleting staff entries. All data is stored persistently in a **binary file (staff.txt)**, ensuring it remains available across program runs.  
This project demonstrates key C programming concepts such as **structures, file handling, control flow, and modular programming**, making it ideal for beginners, students, and small-scale administrative purposes.

# 📌 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

## User Interface
- Operates entirely through the terminal (CLI)
- Displays a clear and simple menu
- Validates user input before processing

## Staff Record Operations
### ➕ Add Staff  
Allows the user to enter staff ID, name, age, designation, and salary. Data is saved to `staff.txt`.

### 📋 Display Staff  
Prints all stored staff records in a formatted table.

### 🔍 Search Staff  
Searches the database using a unique staff ID.

### ✏️ Update Staff  
Allows modification of name, age, designation, or salary for an existing record.

### ❌ Delete Staff  
Deletes a record permanently using a temporary file method for safety.

## Data Management
- Uses binary file storage for speed and simplicity  
- Implements safe update/delete operations using temporary file handling  
- Gracefully handles empty or missing data files  

## Program Flow
- Menu loops until the user selects **Exit**
- Displays confirmations and error messages
- Ensures smooth transitions between operations

## 2️⃣ Run the Executable

### Linux / macOS:
./staff

### Windows:
staff.exe

## 3️⃣ Data File
Program automatically creates `staff.txt` if it does not exist  
All staff records are saved to and loaded from this file in binary format
